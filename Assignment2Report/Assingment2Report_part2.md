# I'am starting with showing the GUI of adding a light and Point or parallel and applying appropriate transformations on each light type
## When adding a point light source it's drawn as a triangle on the screen and starting position is the center of the model
## Showing in the picture two added point light sources both are translated, i thought about removing local rotation from the transformations of the point light source because only the world rotation that does a difference which changes the light's position.

## Now I'll add another light source but this time it's parallel light source and changed the colors for all the lights.
