# Computer-Graphics-Project
By using C++, ImGui, OpenGL,my project was loading a mesh model as an obj file then displaying it as a wire-frame model and applying transformations on it, fill the model with a color then implementing the Z_buffer algorithm to remove hidden surface,and now currently working on converting the project into working on the GPU instead of the CPU using OpenGL and GLSL.
